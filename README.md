<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Unreal Engine 5 - Kitchen Island Demo

![S_Far-0000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8254123/208289575-90f58c61-efcc-443f-9283-1e77f0bc1b3f.jpeg)

The modern kitchen island is perfect for rendering beautiful interior scenes and comes with a blueprint that allows you to open and close drawers with the click of a mouse. This Asset comes with 4 different Material instances and 3 Texture packs. It also comes with a highly customizable Master Material that can be used in other projects as well.

A demo scene is available with Sequences and Cameras which was used to create the demo reel, seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TL_3wUWQ_k
